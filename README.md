# The Pitch
Board games are a hobby of mine. One of my favorite games to play with larger groups is A Fake Artist Goes to New York, which is basically Pictionary meets Spyfall or Werewolf. Everyone takes turns drawing lines to form an image, but one player (the fake artist) doesn't know what the subject of the drawing is supposed to be. Rather than have one person sit out to provide the word secretly to the players, my project will distribute the word or inform the player that they are the fake artist. This system can be used for similar games like Spyfall or Chameleon. Players will join a group room on their phones, specify the category of words and how many fake artists or spies should be selected, and then the application will select at random the word and the players to leave in the dark. If time permits, I would like to implement ways for individuals to create their own custom libraries of words.

# Proposed Features:
- Personal rooms that all players can join together on their personal devices using a code
- Randomly selected words distributed to randomly selected players
- The ability to keep track of roles in case of disconnect (either tying to a player name or with cookies)
- A variety of general categories to select from
- The ability to create custom categories tied to a user account
- Dynamic layout for mobile functionality

HTTPS stands for Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol. Data is encrypted using the TLS protocol. The curl command can be used to see the output of the HTTPS exchange. Let's Encrypt creates trusted web certificates for free, and Caddy used Let's Encrypt to generate the web certificate for this project.

# HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML provides the foundational content structure that all web applications build upon. HTML elements are represented with enclosing tags.
| Tags     | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ```<p id="hello"> </p>``` | A structural paragraph of text with a unique id attribute|
| ```<html> </html>``` | Represents the top level page structure |
| ```<head> </head>``` | Contains metadata about the page and page title |
| ```<title> </title>``` | Page title |
| ```<body> </body>``` | Represents the content structure |
| ```<main> </main>``` | Represents the main content structure |
| ```<a href="https://byu.edu"> </a>``` | Anchor element with hyperlink reference attribute |

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Converts the structure and content of HTML to build responsive design and style. CSS defines 'rulesets' or 'rules', comprised of a 'selector' that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more 'declarations' that represent the 'property' to style with the given 'property value'.  

Example rule applying to 'p' elements and using 4 declarations:
```css
p {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 2em;
  color: navy;
  text-shadow: 3px 3px 1px #cccccc;
}
```
You can define CSS rules within the HTML document by using the HTML 'style' element. Alternatively, you can create a hyperlink reference to an external css file.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
```
Rules cascade from highest to lowest nodes in DOM tree, and thus declaration properties defined at a lower level will override higher declarations.  

Selectors can be used widely for all elements of a certain type, or you can use combinators to specify necessary descendancy, like so:
```css
section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
```

There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

| Combinator       | Meaning                    | Example        | Description                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Descendant       | A list of descendants      | `body section` | Any section that is a descendant of a body |
| Child            | A list of direct children  | `section > p`  | Any p that is a direct child of a section  |
| General sibling  | A list of siblings         | `p ~ div`      | Any p that has a div sibling               |
| Adjacent sibling | A list of adjacent sibling | `p + div`      | Any p that has an adjacent div sibling     |

You can also use selectors to specify classes of objects (objects with a class atribute).  
```css
.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.

```css
p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
You can use a pound sign to select an object with an id.  
Attribute selectors select elements based on their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (`a[href]`). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (`a[href="./fish.png"]`) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (`p[href*="https://"]).
```css
p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
```

HTTP headers specify metadata about a request or response. This includes things like how to handle security, caching, data formats, and cookies. Some common headers that you will use include the following.

Cookies: HTTP itself is stateless. This means that one HTTP request does not know anything about a previous or future request. However, that does not mean that a server or client cannot track state across requests. One common method for tracking state is the `cookie`. Cookies are generated by a server and passed to the client as an HTTP header.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Set-Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

The client then caches the cookie and returns it as an HTTP header back to the server on subsequent requests.

```http
HTTP/2 200
Cookie: myAppCookie=tasty
```

This allows the server to remember things like the language preference of the user, or the user's authentication credentials. A server can also use cookies to track, and share, everything that a user does. However, there is nothing inherently evil about cookies, the problem comes from web applications that use them as a means to violate a user's privacy or inappropriately monetize their data. 

Same Origin Policy ( SOP ) only allows JavaScript to make requests to a domain if it is the same domain that the user is currently viewing. Cross Origin Resource Sharing ( CORS ) allows the client (e.g. browser) to specify the origin of a request and then let the server respond with what origins are allowed. 

The fetch API is the preferred way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. The basic usage of fetch takes a URL and returns a promise. The promise `then` function takes a callback function that is asynchronously called when the requested URL content is obtained. If the returned content is of type `application/json` you can use the `json` function on the response object to convert it to a JavaScript object. 

A web service is usually divided up into multiple service endpoints. Each endpoint provides a single functional purpose. All of the criteria that you would apply to creating well designed code functions also applies when exposing service endpoints. Service endpoints are often called an Application Programming Interface (API). Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) expose service endpoints as simple function calls. When RPC is used over HTTP it usually just leverages the POST HTTP verb. The actual verb and subject of the function call is represented by the function name. 

Representational State Transfer (REST) attempts to take advantage of the foundational principles of HTTP. This is not surprising considering the principle author of REST, Roy Fielding, was also a contributor to the HTTP specification. REST HTTP verbs always act upon a resource. Operations on a resource impact the state of the resource as it is transferred by a REST endpoint call. This allows for the caching functionality of HTTP to work optimally. For example, GET will always return the same resource until a PUT is executed on the resource. When PUT is used, the cached resource is replaced with the updated resource. 

# Node

Node.js deploys JavaScript outside of a browser. This changed the JavaScript mindset from a browser technology to one that could run on the server as well. This means that JavaScript can power your entire technology stack. 

Express is a Node.js package. Express provides support for:

1. Routing requests for service endpoints
1. Manipulating HTTP requests with JSON body content
1. Generating HTTP responses
1. Using `middleware` to add functionality

Everything in Express revolves around creating and using HTTP routing and middleware functions. You create an Express application by using NPM to install the Express package and then calling the express constructor to create the express application and listen for HTTP requests on a desired port. HTTP endpoints are implemented in Express by defining routes that call a function based upon an HTTP path. The Express app object supports all of the HTTP verbs as functions on the object. The standard Mediator/Middleware design pattern has two pieces: A mediator and middleware. Middleware represents componentized pieces of functionality. The mediator loads the middleware components and determines their order of execution. When a request comes to the mediator it then passes the request around to the middleware components. Following this pattern, Express is the mediator, and middleware functions are the middleware components. 

When you run a program from the console the program will automatically terminate when you close the console or if the computer restarts. In order to keep programs running after a shutdown you need to register it as a daemon. The term daemon comes from the idea of something that is always there working in the background.

# Storage services

Web applications commonly need to store files associated with the application or the users of the application. This includes files such as images, user uploads, documents, and movies. Files usually have an ID, some metadata, and the bytes representing the file itself. These can be stored using a database service, but usually that is overkill and a simpler solution will be cheaper.

It might be tempting to store files directly on your server. This is usually a bad idea for several reasons.

1. Your server has limited drive space. If you server runs out of drive space your entire application will fail.
1. You should consider your server as being ephemeral, or temporary. It can be thrown away and replaced by a copy at any time. If you start storing files on the server, then your server has state that cannot be easily replaced.
1. You need backup copies of your application and user files. If you only have one copy of your files on your server, then they will disappears when your server disappears, and you must always assume that your server will disappear.

Instead you want to use a storage service that is specifically designed to support production storage and delivery of files. For this class, we use AWS S3.

Data Services: Web applications commonly need to store application and user data persistently. The data can be many things, but it is usually a representation of complex interrelated objects. This includes this like a user profile, organizational structure, game play information, usage history, billing information, peer relationship, library catalog, and so forth. We use MongoDB as it stores data as JSON objects. 

If your application is going to remember a user's data then it will need a way to uniquely associate the data with a particular credential. That usually means that you authenticate a user by asking for information, such as an email address and password. You then remember, for some period of time, that the user has authenticated by storing an authentication token on the user's device. Often that token is stored in a cookie that is passed back to your web service on each request. The service can now associate data that the user supplies with a unique identifier that corresponds to their authorization token.

# WebSocket
HTTP is based on a client server architecture. A client always initiates the request and the server responds. This is great if you are building a global document library connected by hyperlinks, but for many other use cases it just doesn't work. Applications for notifications, distributed task processing, peer to peer communication, or asynchronous events need communication that is initiated by two or more connected devices. 

For years, web developers created hacks to work around the limitation of the client/server model. This included solutions like having the client frequently pinging the server to see if the server had anything to say, or keeping client initiated connections open for a very long time as the client waited for some event to happen on the server. Needless to say, none of these solutions were elegant or efficient. 

Finally, in 2011 the communication protocol WebSocket was created to solve this problem. The core feature of WebSocket is that it is fully duplexed. Meaning that after the initial connection is made from a client, using vanilla HTTP, and then upgraded by the server to a WebSocket connection, the relationship changes to a peer to peer connection where either party can efficiently send data at any time. 

WebSocket connections are still only between two parties. So if you want to facilitate a conversation between a group of users the server must act as the intermediary. Each peer first connects to the server, and then the server forwards messages amongst the peers. 

# Web Frameworks

Web frameworks seek to make the job of writing web applications easier by providing tools for completing common application tasks. This includes things like modularizing code, creating single page applications, simplifying reactivity, and supporting diverse hardware devices.

Some frameworks take things beyond the standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and create new hybrid file formats that combine things like HTML and JavaScript into a single file. Examples of this include React JSX, Vue SFC, and Svelte files. Abstracting away the core web file formats puts the focus on functional components rather than files.

React abstracts HTML into a JavaScript variate called JSX. JSX is converted into valid HTML and JavaScript using a preprocessor called Babel. It mixes both HTML and JavaScript into a single representation. 

React components allow you to modularize the functionality of your application. This allows the underlying code to directly represent the components that a user interacts with. It also enables code reuse as common application component often show up repeatedly. One of the primary purposes of a component is to generate user interface. This is done with the components render function. Whatever is returned from the render function is inserted into the component HTML element. As a simple example, a JSX file containing a React component element named Demo would cause React to load the Demo component, call the render function, and insert the result into the place of the Demo element. React components also allow you to pass information to them in the form of element properties. The component receives the properties in its constructor and then can display them when it renders. In addition to properties, a component can have internal state. Component state is created by calling the React.useState hook function. The useState function returns a variable that contains the current state and a function to update the state. In addition to the preferred function style components demonstrated above, React also supports class style components. However, you should note that the React team is moving away from the class style representation, and for that reason you should probably not use it. A component's properties and state are used by the React framework to determine the reactivity of the interface. Reactivity controls how a component reacts to actions taken by the user or events that happen within the application. Whenever a component's state or properties change, the render function for the component and all of its dependent component render functions are called.

Making the UI react to changes in user input or data, is one of the architectural foundations of React. React enables reactivity with three major pieces of a React component: props, state, and render.

When a component's JSX is rendered, React parses the JSX and creates a list of any references to the component's state or prop objects. React then monitors those objects and if it detects that they have changed it will call the component's render function so that the impact of the change is visualized.

React hooks allow React function style components to be able to do everything that a class style component can do and more. Additionally, as new features are added to React they are including them as hooks. This makes function style components the preferred way of doing things in React. The useEffect hook allows you to represent lifecycle events. You can control what triggers a useEffect hook by specifying its dependencies. 

# Toolchains
As web programming becomes more and more complex it became necessary to abstract away some of that complexity with a series of tools. Some common functional pieces in a web application chain include:

- **Code repository** - Stores code in a shared, versioned, location.
- **Linter** - Removes, or warns, of non-idiomatic code usage.
- **Prettier** - Formats code according to a shared standard.
- **Transpiler** - Compiles code into a different format. For example, from JSX to JavaScript.
- **Polyfill** - Generates backward compatible code for supporting old browser versions that do not support the latest standards.
- **Bundler** - Packages code into bundles for delivery to the browser. This enables compatibility (for example with ES6 module support), or performance (with lazy loading).
- **Minifier** - Removes whitespace and renames variables in order to make code smaller and more efficient to deploy.
- **Testing** - Automated tests at multiple levels to ensure correctness.
- **Deployment** - Automated packaging and delivery of code from the development environment to the production environment.

# Router
A web framework router provides essential functionality for single page applications. With a multiple web page application the headers, footers, navigation, and common components must be either duplicated in each HTML page, or injected before the server sends the page to the browser. With a single page application the browser only loads one HTML page and then JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and give it the appearance of multiple pages. The router defines the routes a user can take through the application, and automatically manipulates the DOM to display the appropriate framework components.

# Security
The internet allows us to socially connect, conduct financial transactions, and provide access to sensitive individual, corporate, and government data. It is also accessible from every corner of the planet. This positions the internet as a tool that can make the world a much better place, but it also makes a very attractive target for those who would seek to do harm. Preventing that potential for harm needs to be in the forefront of you mind whenever you create or use a web application. Even if you don't think your application is valuable enough to require security, you need to consider that you might be creating a security problem for your users on other systems. For example, think about a simple game application where a user is required to provides a username and password in order to play the game. If the application's data is then compromised, then an attacker could use the password, used for the game application, to gain access to other websites where the user might have used the same password. For example, their social networking sites, work account, or financial institution. 

Web application security, sometimes called AppSec, is a subset of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on preventing security vulnerabilities within end-user applications. Web application security involves securing the frontend code running on the user's device and also the backend code running on the web server.

Here is a list of common phrases used by the security community that you should be familiar with.

- **Hacking** - The process of making a system do something it's not supposed to do.
- **Exploit** - Code or input that takes advantage of a programming or configuration flaw.
- **Attack Vector** - The method that a hacker employs to penetrate and exploit a system.
- **Attack Surface** - The exposed parts of a system that an attacker can access. For example, open ports (22, 443, 80), service endpoints, or user accounts.
- **Attack Payload** - The actual code, or data, that a hacker delivers to a system in order to exploit it.
- **Input sanitization** - "Cleaning" any input of potentially malicious data.
- **Black box testing** - Testing an application without knowledge of the internals of the application.
- **White box testing** - Testing an application by **with** knowledge of the source code and internal infrastructure.
- **Penetration Testing** - Attempting to gain access to, or exploit, a system in ways that are not anticipated by the developers.
- **Mitigation** - The action taken to remove, or reduce, a threat.

The following lists some common motivations at drives a system attack.

- **Disruption** - By overloading a system, encrypting essential data, or deleting critical infrastructure, an attacker can destroy normal business operations. This may be an attempt at extortion, or simply be an attempt to punish a business that that attacker does not agree with.
- **Data exfiltration** - By privately extracting, or publicly exposing, a system's data, an attacker can embarrass the company, exploit insider information, sell the information to competitors, or leverage the information for additional attacks.
- **Resource consumption** - By taking control of a company's computing resources an attacker can use it for other purposes such as mining cryptocurrency, gathering customer information, or attacking other systems.

There are a few common exploitation techniques that you should be aware of. These include the following.

- **Injection**: When an application interacts with a database on the backend, a programmer will often take user input and concatenate it directly into a search query. This allows a hacker can use a specially crafted query to make the database reveal hidden information or even delete the database.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: A category of attacks where an attacker can make malicious code execute on a different user's browser. If successful, an attacker can turn a website that a user trusts, into one that can steal passwords and hijack a user's account.

- **Denial of Service**: This includes any attack where the main goal is to render any service inaccessible. This can be done by deleting a database using an SQL injection, by sending unexpected data to a service endpoint that causes the program to crash, or by simply making more requests than a server can handle.

- **Credential Stuffing**: People have a tendency to reuse passwords or variations of passwords on different websites. If a hacker has a user's credentials from a previous website attack, then there is a good chance that they can successfully use those credentials on a different website. A hacker can also try to brute force attack a system by trying every possible combination of password.

- **Social engineering** - Appealing to a human's desire to help, in order to gain unauthorized access or information.

Taking the time to learn the techniques a hacker uses to attack a system is the first step in preventing them from exploiting your systems. From there, develop a security mindset, where you always assume any attack surface will be used against you. Make security a consistent part of your application design and feature discussions. Here is a list of common security practices you should include in your applications.

- **Sanitize input data** - Always assume that any data you receive from outside your system will be used to exploit your system. Consider if the input data can be turned into an executable expression, or can overload computing, bandwidth, or storage resources.
- **Logging** - It is not possible to think of every way that your system can be exploited, but you can create an immutable log of requests that will expose when a system is being exploited. You can then trigger alerts, and periodically review the logs for unexpected activity.
- **Traps** - Create what appears to be valuable information and then trigger alarms when the data is accessed.
- **Educate** - Teach yourself, your users, and everyone you work with, to be security minded. Anyone who has access to your system should understand how to prevent physical, social, and software attacks.
- **Reduce attack surfaces** - Do not open access anymore than is necessary to properly provide your application. This includes what network ports are open, what account privileges are allowed, where you can access the system from, and what endpoints are available.
- **Layered security** - Do not assume that one safeguard is enough. Create multiple layers of security that each take different approaches. For example, secure your physical environment, secure your network, secure your server, secure your public network traffic, secure your private network traffic, encrypt your storage, separate your production systems from your development systems, put your payment information in a separate environment from your application environment. Do not allow data from one layer to move to other layers. For example, do not allow an employee to take data out of the production system.
- **Least required access policy** - Do not give any one user all the credentials necessary to control the entire system. Only give a user what access they need to do the work they are required to do.
- **Safeguard credentials** - Do not store credentials in accessible locations such as a public GitHub repository or a sticky note taped to a monitor. Automatically rotate credentials in order to limit the impact of an exposure. Only award credentials that are necessary to do a specific task.
- **Public review** - Do not rely on obscurity to keep your system safe. Assume instead that an attacker knows everything about your system and then make it difficult for anyone to exploit the system. If you can attack your system, then a hacker will be able to also. By soliciting public review and the work of external penetration testers, you will be able to discover and remove potential exploits.


# TypeScript
TypeScript adds static type checking to JavaScript. This provides type checking while you are writing the code to prevent mistakes like using a string when a number is expected. Because it is so common to define object property types, TypeScript introduced the use of the interface keyword to define a collection of parameters and types that an object must contain in order to satisfy the interface type. TypeScript also provides other benefits, such as warning you of potential uses of an uninitialized variable. TypeScript introduces the ability to define the possible values for a new type. This is useful for doing things like defining an enumerable.

# Performance Monitoring
In order to prevent losing users, you want your application to load in about one second. That means you need consistently measure and improve the responsiveness of your application. The main things you want to monitor include:

1. Browser application latency
1. Network latency
1. Service endpoint latency

For the context of this discussion, latency is defined as the delay that your user experiences before a request is satisfied. 

Browser application latency is impacted by the speed of the user's device, the amount of data that needs to be processed, and the time complexity of the processing algorithm.

When a user requests your application in a browser, the browser will request your `index.html` page first. This is followed by requests for any files that `index.html` links, such as JavaScript, CSS, video, and image files. Once your JavaScript is loaded, it will start making requests to services. This includes any endpoints that your provide as well as ones provided by third parties. Each of those requests takes time for the browser to load and render. A page with lots of large images and lots of service calls, will take longer than a page that only loads simple text from a single HTML file.

Likewise, if your JavaScript does significant processing while a page is loading, then your user will notice the resulting latency. You want to make application processing as asynchronous as possible so that it is done in the background without impacting the user experience.

You can reduces the impact of file size, and HTTP requests in general, by doing one or more of the following:

1. Use compression when transferring files over HTTP.
1. Reduce the quality of images and video to the lowest acceptable level.
1. Minify JavaScript and CSS. This removes all whitespace and creates smaller variable names.
1. Use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 so that your HTTP headers are compressed and the communication protocol is more efficient.

You can also reduce the number of requests you make by combining the responses from multiple endpoint requests into a single request. This eliminates duplicated fields, but also decreases the overhead associated with each request.

You pay a latency price for every network request that you make. For this reason, you want to avoid making unnecessary or large requests.

Network latency is impacted by the amount of data that you send, the amount of data a user can receive per second (this is called bandwidth), and the distance the data has to travel.

If the user has a low bandwidth connection that can only receive data at rates lower than 1 megabit per second, then you need to be very careful to reduce the number of bytes that you send to that user. Global latency is also a problem for users. If your application is hosted in a data center located in San Francisco, and used by someone living in Nairobi, then there will be a additional latency of 100 to 400 milliseconds for each request.

You can mitigate the impact of global latency by hosting your application files in data centers that are close to the users you are trying to serve. Applications that are seeking to reach a global audience will often host their application from dozens of places around the world.

Service endpoint latency is impacted by the number of request that are made and the amount of time that it takes to process each request.

When a web application makes a request to a service endpoint there is usually some functionality in the application that is blocked until the endpoint returns. For example, if a user requests the scores for a game, the application will delay rendering until those scores are returned.

You want to reduce the latency of your endpoints as much as possible. Ideally you want to keep the endpoint latency to less than 10 milliseconds (ms). This may seem like a very short time, but commonly, an application will make dozens of endpoint requests to render a component. If each of those endpoints take 10 ms, then you are looking at 100 to 200 ms. When you add network latency to the time it takes for the application to process the response, and then add the time it takes for the browser to render, you can easily exceed the desired 1 second load time.

# Search Engine Optimization
Once Google became the de facto search engine for the internet, a new industry was created to help websites get the top search result spots. Modifying your application for search results is called search engine optimization (SEO). While SEO has nothing to do with the functionality of your application, it has everything to do with its success. You can save millions of dollars in marketing if your application appears in the top search ranking for common user searches.

There are several factors that are major contributors to your search rank. These include:

1. Content
1. Authoritative links
1. Structure and organization
1. Metadata
1. Performance and usability

# Device APIs
Every year browsers mature and increase the features that they provide. Sometimes these features are exposed as APIs (Application programming interfaces) that allow a web application to interact with the user through browser, operating system, or device features. For example, your application could take advantage of location services that tell you where your user is physically located, or read a user's contacts in order to allow them to share information with their peers. As these APIs become standard across all browsers they enable web applications to behave more and more like historical native device applications.





# Simon Observations
## HTML:
- Semantically different tags for the same functionality are interesting, like menu vs. ul
- Since I'm getting to this late, I am so glad CSS is a thing because using old HTML for the visual fomatting seems like a pain
- Not sure why the name entry doesn't work with the code provided? 
## CSS: 
- WOW this is a huge visual upgrade
- Still missing functionality, but I assume we will be implementing that with the Java
- The Simon game itself is the most visually impressive, but for some reason I am really impressed by the table styling
- I need to make sure I don't get too lost in the CSS on my startup because I can for sure get lost in trying to make it look pretty 
## JS: 
- There's functionality now!
- I still feel like Javascript is the weird love child of Java and Python that makes less sense than either one
- I think the main thing throwing me off is using this.element without having to first declare element as a member of the class
- need to reference the documentation so I know all the style attributes I can manipulate 
## Service: 
- The random picture and quote is kind of fun, though I don't know that I would use those in my startup project
- Local storage is still useful in case internet goes wack
- index.js is interesting as a routing point for basic functioning 
## Database: 
- Now we're actually using those endpoints from Service!
- The scores page is where it's most noticeable; greater feeling of interconnectedness seeing other people's high scores
- Random quote of the day: Does wisdom perhaps appear on the earth as a raven which is inspired by the smell of carrion? 
## Login: 
- Yay secure login using cookies!
- Also nice how it hides login controls depending on login state
- This one has a combined login/create account page, unlike my startup. Ah well. 
## WebSocket: 
- Simon: now with peer to peer communication!
- More than the score list, the communication between active players makes this experience more of a group thing (or would, if other people were playing)
- PeerProxy handles the protocol change to WebSocket from HTTP 
## React: 
- This takes a lot of reorganization
- Cool collaboration between Bootstrap and React with the NPM package
- Modular design instead of redundant HTML seems like a much better way to design things... will want to start with this in future project rather than trying to retrofit React into a pure HTML/CSS/JS project 

# Startup Observations
## HTML: 
- br tags are necessary but annoying
- I think the option group stuff will be really helpful for the project, I just hope I'm able to dynamically change options when the user is logged in
- As I worked on this, I feel like there were just more and more pages I realized I needed; can you drastically change content depending on login status? 
## CSS: 
- I got it to look pretty!
- Hamburger menus are harder than I would have thought
- I definitely looked up some code, but I feel like I was able to innovate and make the website look how I want it to
- Using hamburger menu everywhere b/c project is mobile first, and I don't need to overcomplicate navigation with how much is left to accomplish
## JavaScript:
- Requirement i: Logged in users can create custom sets and add to them, adding these sets to a mock database in localstorage
- Requirement ii: Once logged in, the user can see their name displayed in the hamburger navigation menu, along with a button to log out
- Requirement iii: The tables displayed all get their content from injected data into the DOM, including custom sets
- Requirement iv: All of the mock database data is stored in localstorage, along with info about the current user, the current player name, and much more
- Requirement v: The information provided in game when clicking "View My Knowledge" or "Start Round" will be distributed using WebSocket so all players can see the shared secret word (with the exception of the spy). This will pop up once a new round has started.
- The website is functional! Even if it's a little jank because it's all using local storage instead of a database... the word is randomly selected, the spies are randomly selected, it works!
- If trying to test it out, be aware that you will have to reset the PlayerName to be the same as the host in order to trigger a new round with a new word and different spies
- Things get complex real fast
- JSON objects not keeping class functionality when pulled from localstorage is annoying
# Service
- API endpoints kind of work?
- nodemon is amazing
- Can pass args in through request body or through url
- I am very confused, but that is ok
